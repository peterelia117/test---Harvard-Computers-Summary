The Harvard Computers were a group of female astronomers at the Harvard Observatory  which began in the early days of astrophotography in the 1870s and lasting to the 1930s, originally organized by Edward Pickering (later taken over by Annie Cannon when Pickering died in 1919) to perform various calculations at cheaper hourly rates than men at the time. They made many discoveries. Henrietta Leavitt uncovered the Cepheid period-luminosity relation while working as one of the Computers, which allowed them to determine the distance to Andromeda, and contributed to the realization that the Milky Way was one of many galaxies; Antonia Maury discovered binary stars from spectral analyses; and Willamina Fleming discovered the first white dwarf, as well as the Horsehead Nebula.
They also came up with the OBAFGKM stellar classification system that we use today, which is of paramount importance to us, as it basically defines why we say blue stragglers are straggling. The system originally had more letters and it was arranged based on Balmer absorption lines, but was later rearranged when Planck's Law was discovered relating color to temperature.
        The Computers also did comprehensive sky surveys from photographic plates, including several surveys of globular clusters (which is how they found out about the Cepheid variable relation).
